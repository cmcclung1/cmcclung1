- 👋 Hi, I’m Carrie
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things! Writing, documentation, libraries, information, thrifting, reading, books, my family, hiking, lakes, being outside, good beer, and I could go on for hours about this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub (lol), how to have work-life balance (whatever that means)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff for work probably
- 📫 How to reach me on here for now.
